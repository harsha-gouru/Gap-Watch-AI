"""
Module for monitoring accuracy degradation due to quantization.

This module provides functionality to compare the accuracy of a full-precision
model (e.g., FP16) with its quantized version (e.g., INT8) and alert if
the accuracy drop exceeds a predefined threshold.

    Simulates the evaluation of FP16 and quantized models to check for accuracy drop.

    This function currently uses hardcoded accuracy values for simulation purposes.
    Actual model loading, evaluation, and quantization logic will be added later.

    Args:
        model_fp16_path (str): Path to the full-precision (FP16) model.
        model_quantized_path (str): Path to the quantized model.
        test_dataset_path (str): Path to the test dataset for evaluation.
        accuracy_threshold_delta (float): The maximum allowable drop in accuracy
                                          before an alert is triggered.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - 'accuracy_fp16' (float): Simulated accuracy of the FP16 model.
            - 'accuracy_quantized' (float): Simulated accuracy of the quantized model.
            - 'accuracy_drop' (float): The difference (accuracy_fp16 - accuracy_quantized).
            - 'alert_triggered' (bool): True if accuracy_drop > accuracy_threshold_delta,
                                        False otherwise.

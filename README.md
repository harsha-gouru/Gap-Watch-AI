Below is a rapid‑scan of the **current gap landscape** in AI—from “small but painful” to “industry‑wide” issues—followed by a compact, actionable project idea and a ready‑to‑use README scaffold. The suggested project (“**GapWatch‑AI**”) tackles the first two gaps — reproducibility and energy‑aware edge deployment—because they’re immediately solvable in a single repo yet unlock outsized downstream benefits.

## Gap Map (2025 snapshot)

| Scale                | Unmet Need                                                                                                                                                    | Evidence & Notes |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Micro (per‑repo)** | *Reproducible builds & experiments* are still brittle; 56 % of practitioners report they cannot re‑run even their own models a month later. ([AIMultiple][1]) |                  |
|                      | **Energy visibility** during training/inference is poor, even though fine‑tuning a 7‑B LLM can emit > 500 kg CO₂. ([Nature][2], [arXiv][3])                   |                  |
| **Project**          | **Edge‑AI shocks**: quantization often drops accuracy ≥ 5 pp on small devices without tooling to flag the loss early. ([Red Hat][4], [arXiv][3])              |                  |
|                      | **Data‑privacy leaks** through training artifacts and logs jumped 56 % YoY. ([Kiteworks][5], [WSJ][6])                                                        |                  |
| **Org‑wide**         | **Regulatory readiness** for the EU AI Act (mandatory audits, traceability) is low across US startups. ([Alation][7])                                         |                  |
|                      | **Multimodal alignment** still fails on entity‑matching across text/image/audio. ([NeurIPS Proceedings][8])                                                   |                  |
| **Ecosystem**        | **Long‑context reasoning** stalls beyond a few‑k tokens; quadratic cost remains unsolved. ([arXiv][9])                                                        |                  |
|                      | **Benchmark gap**: models ace IMO‑style math but bomb logic/planning sets like PlanBench. ([Stanford HAI][10])                                                |                  |
|                      | **Agentic failure modes** (memory poisoning, reward hacking) lack open‑source test harnesses. ([Microsoft][11])                                               |                  |

*Why start small?* Fixing reproducibility + energy metrics yields quick wins, de‑risks future compliance work, and supplies trustworthy data for the larger issues (privacy, regulation, safety).

## 🛠 Project Concept: **GapWatch‑AI**

> **Tagline:** *“One‑click reproducibility & green‑meter for every ML repo.”*

GapWatch‑AI is a lightweight CLI + dashboard that **records exact build state, datasets, model hashes, and live GPU/CPU kWh** during every run, then **re‑executes the job inside a deterministic container on demand**. It plugs into Jules (or any CI) as a post‑train hook, writing tamper‑proof provenance for audits and flagging when a new commit increases energy per inference.

Key modules

1. **ReplayKit** — locks Conda/Pip, seeds, and data URLs; stores in a JSON‑LD manifest.
2. **GreenMeter** — samples device power draw; normalises by tokens/forward pass.
3. **EdgeGuard** — runs quantised vs‑FP16 evaluation; alerts on > 𝛿 accuracy drop.
4. **JulesConnector** — auto‑comments results back on the PR that triggered the run.

## 📄 Ready‑made README.md

```markdown
# GapWatch‑AI

One‑click reproducibility tracking **and** energy‑usage auditing for any ML or LLM project.  
Built for async agents like **Google Jules** but works in plain GitHub Actions.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Deterministic replays** – container + seed lockfile (`gapwatch.jsonld`)
- **Live GreenMeter** – kWh, CO₂, & watt‑hours / output‑token
- **EdgeGuard** – verifies post‑quantization accuracy on test sets
- **CI / Jules integration** – adds status checks & PR comments
- **Zero‑config dashboard** – `npm run dev` spins up a SvelteKit UI

---

## 🏗 Architecture

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install gapwatch-ai
gapwatch init            # creates lockfile
gapwatch train scripts/train_bert.py --epochs 3
gapwatch replay <run_id> # deterministic rerun
````

Add to CI:

```yaml
- name: GapWatch
  run: gapwatch ci --quantize int8 --notify
```

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
# http://localhost:5173
```

Displays **energy / step**, accuracy deltas, and a “replay” button.

## 🗺 Roadmap

* [ ] EU AI‑Act audit report export (XAI tags)
* [ ] ARM & Apple‑Silicon energy probes
* [ ] Agentic‑safety fuzz tests plug‑in
* [ ] Multi‑modal dataset hashing

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork → feature branch → PR.
2. All code must pass `ruff` + `pytest`.
3. New features require a demo in `/examples`.

## 📄 License

Apache‑2.0

### Next Steps

1. **Bootstrap repo & CI skeleton** (Jules Stage 0).  
2. Queue Jules tasks: *docstrings*, *lint*, *baseline tests*.  
3. Dog‑food GapWatch on itself—every check‑in measures its own kWh!

By targeting **reproducibility** and **energy transparency** first, we close two immediate gaps while laying groundwork for bigger challenges like privacy auditing and agent‑safety testing down the line.
